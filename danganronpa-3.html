        <h1>Danganronpa V3: Killing Harmony</h1>
        <div class="content">Danganronpa V3: Killing Harmony is a Japanese visual novel game developed by Spike Chunsoft. It is the third main title in the Danganronpa series. It was released in Japan on January 12th, 2017 for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita. It was launched
            on PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, and Steam for PC in North America on September 26th, 2017, and in Europe on September 29th, 2017.</div>
        <div class="content">"Welcome to a new world of Danganronpa, and prepare yourself for the biggest, most exhilarating episode yet. Set in a "psycho-cool" environment, a new cast of 16 characters find themselves kidnapped and imprisoned in a school. Inside, some will
            kill, some will die, and some will be punished. Reimagine what you thought high-stakes, fast-paced investigation was as you investigate twisted murder cases and condemn your new friends to death. Forget what you thought you knew about Danganronpa
            and join a completely new cast of Ultimates for a brand-new beginning. In a world where everyone is trying to survive, nobodyâ€™s motivations are quite what they seem. Use your skills to solve each new murder or meet a gruesome end. The world
            is shaped by our perception of it. Fast-paced trial scenes will require lies, quick wits, and logic to guide your classmates to the right conclusions." - Official synopsis.</div>
        <div class="content">With Danganronpa 3: The End of Hope's Peak High School closing the Hope's Peak Academy story arc, Danganronpa V3: Killing Harmony takes place in a new school, with a completely new cast of characters, acting as the start of a new arc rather than
            a direct sequel to the previous two main titles. Despite this, the gameplay and story take place along a similar linear path to the previous main titles while adding new gameplay elements.</div>
        <div class="content">Like its predecessors, the game's progression is chapter-based and split into three major gameplay types: character interaction, investigation, and Class Trials. The player controls the protagonist from a first-person perspective and can explore
            the school at their leisure, with additional parts of the school becoming available as the plot progresses. Interacting with certain characters or objects is used to progress the story. In each chapter, a murder must be solved, which is up
            to the protagonist and their classmates to investigate and solve, culminating in a class trial inside the school's courtroom.</div>
        <div class="content">The game introduced the concept of "smacking" objects to look for Monocoins while exploring the school, which removes the in-game models from the room. As in previous games, the protagonist can interact with other students and improve their relationship
            through Free Time Events.</div>

            <h2>Opinion</h2>
            <div>Now, this one was by far the best game in the series in terms of graphics, gameplay, etc. Storywise, it was also on par with Danganronpa 2. When this game first came out, I couldn't wait to play it, that I actually watched demo gameplay on
                YouTube. And damn, it was fun as hell. And if you're into a huge, mind-blowing plot twist, play it. PLAY IT, but only after you've finished the first two Danganronpa games.</div>
