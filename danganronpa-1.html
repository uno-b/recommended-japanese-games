        <h1>Danganronpa 1 : Trigger Happy Havoc</h1>
        <div class="content">Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc is a Japanese visual novel game developed by Spike Chunsoft, and the first game in the Danganronpa series. It was released in Japan on November 25, 2010, for PlayStation Portable, and was later ported to PlayStation
            Vita, iOS/Android, PlayStation 4, and PC. The game was later localized and released in English by NIS America on February 11, 2014.</div>
        <div class="content">In Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc, the player controls Makoto Naegi, a student at Hope's Peak who is forced into a killing game with other students. Each chapter is divided into two parts: School Life, in which the player can explore the academy
            and progress through the story, and the Class Trial, in which the player must deduce the culprit of a murder. During School Life, the player can explore the school grounds in the first-person perspective. In certain locations, the player moves
            a crosshair cursor to converse with other characters and interact with various objects. Examining specific objects yields the player Monocoins, which can be redeemed for presents from The All-Mighty Monomono Machine located in the school's
            store. As the game progresses, more areas in the academy become available along with places that were sealed off in the previous chapter(s) on accessible floors.</div>
        <div class="content">Once a murder has occurred, the game transitions into Deadly Life, where the player must look for clues throughout the academy. Evidence and testimonies, or "Truth Bullets", are stored in the player's e-Handbook. After all possible Truth Bullets
            are found, the game shifts to the Class Trial.</div>

            <h2>Opinion</h2>
            <div>I've actually watched the anime first when I didn't even know that this game existed. It wasn't until I played Danganronpa 2 that I learned about it and played it. Overall, I enjoyed playing it. Though the enjoyment wasn't as high as when
                I played Danganronpa 2, probably because I already knew everything from the anime. As for whether to go for the game or the anime, I'd definitely say the game. The anime misses out on so many little details from the game.</div>
