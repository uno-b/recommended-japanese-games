        <h1>Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair</h1>
        <div class="content">Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair is the sequel to Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc. It was first released in Japan on July 26, 2012, for the PlayStation Portable, then was released for the PlayStation Vita on October 10, 2013. The game was subsequently
            set for an NA and EU release by NIS America on September 24, 2013.</div>
        <div class="content">Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair takes place shortly after the events of Trigger Happy Havoc and Danganronpa Another Episode: Ultra Despair Girls. The game is from Hajime Hinata's point of view as he starts his first year at Hope's Peak Academy.
            As he walks into the school building, he is overcome with fatigue; when he recovers, he finds himself in front of a door. He has a strong urge to open it, and once he does, he finds himself in a classroom full of his new classmates.

        <div class="content">They suddenly find themselves locked in the classroom, and a pink bunny, Usami, appears before them, claiming herself to be the class' teacher. The classroom around them soon falls away to reveal a paradise-like island. Usami tells them that they
            are on a school trip and that they are to befriend each other to gain Hope Fragments and make their hope grow.</div>
        <div class="content">Just as they get used to the peaceful island life, Monokuma appears and takes control of the island, announcing that the students must participate in a life of mutual killing if they wish to escape.</div>

            <h2>Opinion</h2>
            <div>This is the first-ever game I played from the series, and I totally enjoyed it! It left so much impression on me. I remember the time when I finished downloading it and played it. I was hooked. I couldn't stop playing well until midnight.
                I was living alone in my apartment at the time, so no one could stop me. I had made a lot of progress that night (maybe), but it was getting late, so I had to sleep. When I woke up, the first thing that came to my mind was continuing the
                game. Fast. Now that I think about it, it's not the best game I've ever played. But at the time, it was the best game ever. Definitely recommended if you've finished playing Danganronpa 1.</div>
